# hello-word
Learning how github works, have lots of ideas but don't know how to code
Mai 20th 06:46, I am editing for the first time a branch and I will try to put it in the master project soon. What's the point of all of this? I love blockchain and I want to talk about my project to a lot of Developers so we can find solution for lots of problems.
